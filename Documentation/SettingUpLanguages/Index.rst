Setting up languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Languages are defined in the site configuration on a per-rootpage
basis. When creating a new page on root level via TYPO3 Backend,
a very basic site configuration is generated on the fly.
It prevents immediate errors due to missing configuration and can
also serve as a starting point for all further actions.

The Introduction Package's default languages are English, Danish
and German languages. Adding a new language is done in the
"Sites" module in the "Site Management" area of the backend.

   Detailed information on how to extend the site configuration
   with additional languages can be found in the
   :ref:`Site Handling Documentation <t3coreapi:sitehandling-basics>`.

Once you have defined at least one additional language,
you have the option of translating pages and content.
For example, the **WEB > List** module will show links
for translating, provided you have translated the page
and checked the "Localization view" at the bottom of
the screen.

Translated elements appears nested "under" their default language
parent element in the **WEB > List** view.
