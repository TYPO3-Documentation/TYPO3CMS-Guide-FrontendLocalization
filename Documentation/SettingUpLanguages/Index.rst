Setting up languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each language into which you want your web site to be translated
must be defined explicitely. These come in addition to the so-called
"default" language. That default language is whatever you decide it
to be.

The system languages are added on the root level of the page tree.
The Introduction Package comes with Danish and German predefined.

Once you have defined at least one system language,
you have the option of translating pages and content.
For example, the **WEB > List** module will show links
for translating, provided you have translated the page
and checked the "Localization view" at the bottom of
the scren.
