Localization modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The localization mode defines how the system behaves if there is no
translation of a page to the language requested (ie. there is no
Alternative Page Language record). Would you like a
"Page not found" error to happen? Or should the default language be shown? Or
should another of the available languages be tried first? And if so,
would you like the menu to stay in the selected language? These are
the preferences you can obtain using this setting.


.. _localization-modes-combinations:

Overview of combinations
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Localization mode is defined by the TypoScript configuration
:code:`config.sys_language_mode`.

The table below provides an overview of the combinations of language
modes (:code:`config.sys_language_mode`) and the language uid
(:code:`config.sys_language_uid`, which is essentially defined by the input
"&L=" variable in a typical set-up).

- The first two columns display the configured values

- The next two columns display the value of internal variables in TYPO3 CMS

- The last columns describes the behavior of the page rendering process

- The settings are based on a page where:

  - none of the :ref:`Localization Setting checkboxes <localization-overview>`
    are set (meaning that neither default language, nor non-existing alternative languages are
    blocked)

  - There is a German translation but no Danish translation.

.. note::

   The behavior for the default language (English) and the existing translation
   (German) is not interesting: when they are requested, they will be shown
   because they exist. They are still shown in the table below as a comparison
   to what happens for the non existing translation (Danish).

This is the corresponding Localization overview for the example
being discussed:

.. _localization-modes-notes:

A few additional technical notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Regardless of localization mode the "&L=" variable is always passed on
  in links (due to "config.linkVars")

- Any TypoScript conditions (for example "[globalVar = GP:L=1]") are
  still effective so any settings there are kept regardless of
  localization mode

- When saying "a translation exists" it is meant that an "Alternative
  Page Language" record exists (green background in Localization
  Overview in **WEB > Info**). This, however, does not refer to whether or not
  content elements are localized for the page yet. However, it is
  generally assumed that if an Alternative Page Language record has been
  created, so has content been translated.

- The internal values :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_uid` and
  :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_content` have different purposes:

  - :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_uid` defines the *overall language* that content
    should be displayed in. This affects menu generation, etc.

  - :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_content` defines the language of the *page
    content* and may be different. This is what makes it
    possible to request content from another language than that of
    :code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_uid`

- If the "Localization Setting" of the page is set to "Hide default
  translation of page" then it will fail when used with
  "content\_fallback" and if "content\_fallback" tries to get content from
  the default language.


.. _localization-modes-best-practice:

Best-practice localization mode
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is recommended to use:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   config.sys_language_mode = content_fallback

This is so, because the compatibility with other localization
functions are greatest in this case since the
:code:`$GLOBALS['TSFE']->sys_language_uid` value is set to that of the requested
language.
