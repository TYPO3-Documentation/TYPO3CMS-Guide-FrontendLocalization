Translating pages
=================

When you want to translate a page in the page tree you create an
"alternative page language" record on that page. This contains fields
similar to that of the page record of the default language which you fill in
with translated content.

Select the :guilabel:`Language Comparison` function in the upper menu bar of the
:guilabel:`Web > Page` module. Then use the select box to create a new
translation of the page:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Record/CreateNewTranslationOfPage.png
    :alt: Create a new translation of the page
    :class: with-shadow

    Create a new translation of the page

The form with the fields for the translated page will then be displayed:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Record/AlternativePageLanguage.png
    :alt: Editing the page fields for an alternative page language
    :class: with-shadow

    Editing the page fields for an alternative page language

Most of the fields are the same as for the page of the default language. Below
the fields the content of the default language is shown.

If a page has no translation (that means, no "alternative page language" record),
its content cannot be translated, no matter how many system languages
have been defined.
