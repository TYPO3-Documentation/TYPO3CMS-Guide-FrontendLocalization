Translating pages
=================

In order to translate a page in the page tree you create a
copy of that record starting by its parent page. 
It will be generated in the default language with fields prefixed by a text similar to "[Translate to Language X:]". 
The translated content needs to be put here instead of this prefix and the original text.

Select the :guilabel:`Language Comparison` function in the upper menu bar of the
:guilabel:`Web > Page` module. Then use the select box to create a new
translation of the page:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Record/CreateNewTranslationOfPage.png
    :alt: Create a new translation of the page
    :class: with-shadow

    Create a new translation of the page

The form with the fields for the translated page will then be displayed:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/Record/AlternativePageLanguage.png
    :alt: Editing the page fields for an alternative page language
    :class: with-shadow

    Editing the page fields for an alternative page language

All of the fields are the same as for the page of the default language. Below
the fields the content of the default language is shown.

If a page has no translation,
its content cannot be translated, no matter how many system languages
have been defined.
