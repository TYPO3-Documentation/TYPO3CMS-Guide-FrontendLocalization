Translating pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you want a translation of a page in the page tree you create an
"Alternative Page Language" record on that page. This contains fields
similar to that of the page record which you fill in with translated
content:

   :alt: Defining an alternative page language

   Editing form for an alternative page language

Obviously, the most important field is the "Language" field. Most
of the fields are the same as for pages.

If a page has no translation (i.e. no "Alternative Page Language" record),
its content cannot be translated, no matter how many system languages
have been defined.
